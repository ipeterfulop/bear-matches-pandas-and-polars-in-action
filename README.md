![Cover image](pandas_and_polars_in_action.png)

Pandas and Polars are two powerful Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, and while they're similar in many ways, they also have some key differences:

- **Syntax/API**: Though many functions have similar names, there are differences in syntax and method names.
- **Performance**: Polars is built for high performance, often leveraging Rust's efficiency, resulting in faster execution times compared to Pandas.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Polars supports lazy evaluation, offering more optimization opportunities during execution.

This repository features challenging assignments with solutions in both Pandas and Polars, aiming to compare their syntax and performance.

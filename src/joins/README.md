## 3. Joins

### Inner Joins
### Outer Joins
### Left Joins

* The **Retrieve the movies with no genres associated** example demonstrates 
      how to performa left join between two DataFrames to retrieve the movies 
      that have no genres associated with them. Also offers an alternative solution
      which is based on the dataframe joining.    
      **Solutions**: [Pandas](pandas/movies_with_no_genres.py) | Polars 

### Right Joins
### Cross Joins
### Concatenation

Each example is designed to be easy to understand and implement, complete with explanations and sample data. 
By exploring these examples, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to 
effectively join DataFrames in Pandas and Polars, making your data analysis tasks more efficient and powerful.
